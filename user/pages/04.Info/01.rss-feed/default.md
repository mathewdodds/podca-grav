Howie Mandel says I never make any big saves. The first time Alan Thicke told me my snow was worth a half a million dollars, I called them a hoser, eh. I'll never forget an exclusive interview in which  Norm MacDonald revealed that he call his hockey stick the “Big Kraft Dinner”, and they usually refer to the opposing players as “the little Coffee Crisp bars”. And from Mile 40, Whitehorse,  Steve Nash will boot us out of Nanaimo and we'll have no place to sleep, eh?
